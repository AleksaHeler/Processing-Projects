# Processing-Projects
A list of some old projects and experiments in [Processing](https://processing.org/) environment. I used Processing as it is free and open sourc, and is easy to get started with. It has built in setup and draw functions (setup is called once on start, draw is looping). It also has a very extensive [reference](https://processing.org/reference/), and a lot of [libraries](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/). Here are some [tutorials](https://processing.org/tutorials/) and [examples](https://processing.org/examples).
